Create a sleek, modern logo for a restaurant named LICRESTOR. The design should emphasize fine dining, quality food, and elegance with clean lines and a balanced layout. Use a minimal color palette (e.g., deep green, gold, or charcoal) to give it a sophisticated, timeless appeal. Include only a very subtle touch of Cameroonian inspiration—perhaps through color tones or a small abstract detail—without making it the focus.
